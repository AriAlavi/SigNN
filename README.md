## Abstract
Our project does real-time translation of American Sign Language into English text (characters only for now); all data was self-collected and we used google collab to collect, aggregate, and analyze data. We achieved this objective using Mediapipe, a machine learning application that can handle live streams of data. ??We like to think of it as Duolingo for ASL??

## Motivation
There have been many attempts at creating a similar project like ours but none work very well. So, we wanted to make one such project that works best. We knew this was going to be a difficult undertaking which is why we wanted to work on this project. We wanted to make something that would be able to help people communicate and connect with each other regardless of language barriers and sound barriers.

## Methodology
When we began work on our project we had Mediapipe. Mediapipe provided a solid foundation for both data collection as well as hand tracking. This meant that we already had a major obstacle removed, 
hand tracking, which meant we didn't have to waste time creating our own hand tracking system. 

There was a tradeoff, Mediapipe was new and barely documented, meaning we had to learn how it worked 
with almost no resources to look to, not even StackOverflow. We eventually learned enough about Mediapipe to get it working and started work on some algorithms as well as a neural network to turn 
coordinates into letters. 

When we returned from Winter Break we not only had 2 working algorithms but a neural network that was accurate 87% of the time. We knew the algorithms were going to become 
obsolete within a few weeks of their completion, but they provided insight into potential obstacles that the neural network may encounter.

For example, some letters were acidentally detected more often
than others such as M or I due to sharing characteristics with multiple other letters. (Insert M and I images here)
